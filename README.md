# Dumb Stickman

In this project, we have demonstrated the movements of a stickman in 4 directions. The stickman has been initially placed in the middle of the window. From the current position of the stickman, it will be able to move left, right, up and down. While moving up and
down, its size will decrease or increase. 4 blocks from the center to any of the 4 directions has been considered as the limit of the stickman’s movements. If it goes out of bound, the stickman’s color will change and its angle will change momentarily. To achieve this, `OpenGL` library and `Google Colab` platform has been utilized.
